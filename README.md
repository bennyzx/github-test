This example is aimed to demonstrate how to establish a secure communication between Local Git Repo and Remote GitHub Repo, and to clone from/push into Remote GitHub Repo.

Here are two steps on HOWTO, as follows:
1. Establish a secure communication via SSH between them;
2. Use frequently-used git command, such as: git init, git add, git commit, git remote, git fetch, git merge, git push, etc. 
   More available git commands, also refer to git --help

If you're newbie like me, you deserve it.
